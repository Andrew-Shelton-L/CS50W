      <h2>COVID19<h2>
        <p id="ans">'1 in 5 worldwide have health condition that increases risk of severe Covid-19, if infected': Lancet</p>
        <h3>Global Coronavirus (COVID-19) Cases Updates:</h3><p id="ans"> In the past two weeks, countries have reported more than 100,000 new cases almost every day, and 75% are coming from 10 countries, the WHO said.</p>
        <h3>Global Updates:</h3><p id="ans"> Global cases surpassed 8 million, while over 4.36 people have succumbed to the infection. While European borders reopened, China is scrambling to control the spread of a fresh outbreak of coronavirus in Beijing, amid fears of a second wave of the infection in the country. Reopening continued in Mexico and Brazil despite cases climbing in the two largest nations in Latin America. And New Zealand, which had eased the curbs, reported its first new cases since May 22.</p>
        <p id="ans">A Lancet research has found that one in five people worldwide have an underlying health condition that puts them at risk for severe Covid-19 illness if they contract the virus. An estimated 1.7 billion people suffer from conditions ranging from type 2 diabetes to heart disease, according to a study published in The Lancet Global Health. About 349 million of them would probably need to go to the hospital for treatment if they were infected.</p>

        <p id="ans">Clinical researchers began human trials this week of a new coronavirus vaccine developed by scientists at Imperial College London. The study, which involves a set of people being immunised with the vaccine, will be the first time trialled on humans and will test whether it is well-tolerated and produces an effective immune response against COVID-19.</p>
        <p id="ans">The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed thousands of lives and had a huge impact on daily life. In the long-term, a viable vaccine could be vital for protecting the most vulnerable, enabling restrictions to be eased and helping people to get back to normal life, said Professor Robin Shattock, from the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial who is leading the work.</p>
        <p id="ans">The researchers expect to publish findings once the safety data are available and are hopeful a viable vaccine could be available in the first half of 2021. They say the vaccine has undergone rigorous pre-clinical safety tests and in animal studies it has been shown to be safe and produced encouraging signs of an effective immune response.</p>
        <h2>UK unemployment rising ‘faster than Great Depression’</h2>
        <p id="ans">The number of people in the UK claiming job-related benefits increased by a monthly 23.3% in May to 2.8 million, according to official figures released Tuesday that likely underestimate the toll on the labour market of the coronavirus lockdown.</p>
        <p id="ans">The Office for National Statistics said that the so-called claimant count – which includes both people who work on reduced income or hours and those who are actually unemployed – was 125.9% higher than in March, when the country was put into lockdown. The statistics agency also said the number of people on payroll fell by 2.1%, or 612,000, between March and May.</p>
        <h2>Coronavirus tracing app a test for privacy-minded Germany</h2>
        <p id="ans">Germany launched a coronavirus tracing app Tuesday that officials say is so secure even government ministers can use it.</p>
        <p id="ans">Smartphone apps have been touted as a high-tech tool in the effort to track down potential COVID-19 infections. Experts say finding new cases quickly is key to clamping down on fresh clusters, especially as countries slowly emerge from lockdowns and try to avoid a second wave of infections and deaths. But governments in Europe have run into legal and cultural hurdles, trying to reconcile the need for effective tracing with the continent’s strict data privacy standards.</p>
        <p id="ans">Germany, where a person’s right to their own data even after death is rooted in the constitution, has proved a particular challenge. Early government suggestions about using location data including cell tower information and GPS coordinates for the app prompted a swift backlash.</p>
        <h2>Ten nations account for most COVID cases: WHO</h2>
        <p id="ans">In the past two weeks, countries have reported more than 100,000 new cases almost every day, and 75 per cent are coming from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the head of the World Health Organization, said at a briefing in Geneva. That means every day there are more cases reported than during the first two months of the outbreak. There are many hot spots in Latin America, and cases are also increasing in Africa, the Mideast and Central Europe.</p>
