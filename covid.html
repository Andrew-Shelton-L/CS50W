      <h1>COVID19</h1>

        <h2>Description<h2>
        <p id="ans">COVID-19 or more commonly known as the Novel Coronavirus has brought the entire world to a standstill. With the cases of Coronavirus infections increasing at an alarming rate, several nations continue to be in a state of lockdown. As of May 12, 2020, an estimated 4.18 million confirmed cases and 2,18,000 deaths have been recorded due to this unprecedented pandemic across the world. We as a nation have also been severely impacted due to the Coronavirus outbreak, with 46,008 active cases and 2,293 deaths as of May 12. In these trying times, the Indian Government has taken and is actively taking necessary measures to ensure that continuous medical care is available to the Indian citizens and the spread of COVID-19 is contained.</P>
        <p id="ans">Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens, they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections</p>
        <p id="ans">To date, there are no specific vaccines or medicines for COVID-19. Treatments are under investigation, and will be tested through clinical trials. World Health Organization</p>
        <h2>Self-care</h2>
        <p id="ans">If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family members, and use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.</p>
        <p id="ans">Everyone should keep a healthy lifestyle at home. Maintain a healthy diet, sleep, stay active, and make social contact with loved ones through the phone or internet. Children need extra love and attention from adults during difficult times. Keep to regular routines and schedules as much as possible.</p>
        <p id="ans">It is normal to feel sad, stressed, or confused during a crisis. Talking to people you trust, such as friends and family, can help. If you feel overwhelmed, talk to a health worker or counsellor.</p>
        <h2>Medical treatments</h2>
        <p id="ans">If you have mild symptoms and are otherwise healthy, self-isolate and contact your medical provider or a COVID-19 information line for advice.</p>
        <p id="ans">Seek medical care if you have a fever, a cough, and difficulty breathing. Call in advance</p>
